"""Guard the store schema against changes an older lerd cannot read.

A store definition reaches every install within a day, whatever version of lerd
it runs, so the schema may only grow. This compares the YAML in a pull request
against what is already published and refuses the two changes that break a
binary older than the definition: a key that disappeared, and a key whose type
moved under it. A value never before seen for a key that has always held a small
closed set is reported as a warning, since widening an enum breaks an old
binary's switch exactly as retyping does, but only the definition's author can
say whether the binary already knows the new value.

Usage: schema_guard.py <published-dir> <candidate-dir> [glob]
